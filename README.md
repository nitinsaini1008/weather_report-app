# Weather Repoting web app

# Description: -
It is a weather reporting web app made in DJANGO. By using this you can
know the temperature and weather report of your area. You just need to
enter your location. For this app, I use a weather API in my web app.

# Local Set-Up :- 
    $ git clone https://github.com/nitinsaini1008/weather_report-app.git
    $ cd weather_report-app/weather/
    $ pip3 install requirenment.txt
    $ python3 manage.py migrate
    $ python3 manage.py runserver


Then this project will start running at 127.0.0.1:8000
